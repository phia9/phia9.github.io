<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>I got knots all up in my chest (up in my chest, up in my chest)</p>
Just know, I'm trying my best (I'm trying my best)</p>
'Cause, when you look (when you look)</p>
When you laugh (when you laugh)</p>
When you smile (when you smile)</p>
I'll bring you back (bring you back)</p>
And now I'm sad (now I'm sad)</p>
And I'm a mess (and I'm a mess)</p>
And now we high (now we high)</p>
That's, why I left (why I left)</p>
That's, why I left</p>
Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips? (my lips, my lips, my lips)</p>
Will your shadow remember the swing of my hips? (my hips, my hips, my hips)</p>
Will your lover caress you the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)</p>
Will you notice my charm, if he slips up one bit? (one bit)</p>
'Cause I don't need to know</p>
I just wanna make sure you're okay (okay)</p>
I don't need to know</p>
I just wanna make sure you're all safe, all safe, all safe</p>
Will he play you those songs, just the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)</p>
Will he play you so strong, just the way, that I did? (I did)</p>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
Will he treat you like shit, just the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)</p>
'Cause I don't blame ya</p>
'Cause I don't need to know</p>
I just want to make sure you're okay (okay)</p>
I don't need to know</p>
I just want to make sure you're all safe</p>
</p>
