<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low</p>
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes</p>
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that</p>
Dema don't control us, dema don't control</p>
East is up</p>

They want to make you forget</p>
They want to make you forget</p>
Save your razorblades now, not yet</p>
Save your razorblades now, not yet</p>

I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady</p>
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh</p>
I'm so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high</p>
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh</p>

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low</p>
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes</p>
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that</p>
Dema don't control us, dema don't control</p>

I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady</p>
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh</p>
I'm so high, my jumpsuit takes me so high</p>
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh</p>

I'm heavy, jumpsuit is on steady</p>
Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh</p>
I'm so high, I'm so high</p>
So high, I'm so high</p>
Fire, Nico and the Niners</p>

What I say when I want to be enough</p>
What a beautiful day for making a break for it</p>
We'll find a way to pay for it</p>
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores</p>
Rent a race horse and force a sponsor</p>
And start a concert, a complete diversion</p>
Start a mob and you can be quite certain</p>
We'll win but not everyone will get out</p>
No, no</p>
We'll win but not everyone will get out</p>
No, no</p>
We'll win but not everyone will get out</p>

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low</p>
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes</p>
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that</p>
Dema don't control us, dema don't control</p>
East is up</p>

I'm so high, so high</p>
Fire, Nico and the Niners</p>
I'm so high, so high</p>
Fire, Nico and the Niners</p>
