<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>
You used to get it in your fishnets</p>
Now you only get it in your night dress</p>
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</p>
Landed in a very common crisis</p>
Everything's in order in a black hole</p>
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though</p>
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco</p>
Remember when you used to be a rascal?</p>
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had</p>
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams</p>
Not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem</p>
My love, when you dream them up</p>
Flicking through a little book of sex tips</p>
Remember when the boys were all electric?</p>
Now when she's told she's gonna get it</p>
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it</p>
Clinging to not getting sentimental</p>
Said she wasn't going but she went still</p>
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle</p>
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?</p>
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had</p>
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams</p>
Weren't daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem</p>
My love, when you dream them up oh, Flo</p>
Where did you go?</p>
Where did you go? </p>
Where did you go?</p>
You're falling about</p>
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</p>
Just sounding it out</p>
But you're not coming back again</p>
You're falling about</p>
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</p>
You were just sounding it out</p>
But you're not coming back again</p>
You used to get it in your fishnets</p>
(Falling about) Now you only get it in your night dress</p>
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</p>
(You took a left off Last Laugh Lane) Landed in a very common crisis</p>
Everything's in order in a black hole</p>
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though (You were just sounding it out) </p>
(You're not coming back again) That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco</p>
Remember when you used to be a rascal?</p>
</p>
