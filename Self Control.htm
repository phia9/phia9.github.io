<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah</p>
About your summer last night</p>
Ain't give you no play, mm</p>
Could I make it shine last night?</p>
Could I make it shine, on it last night?</p>
Could we make it in? Do we have time?</p>
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight</p>
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white</p>
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life</p>
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice</p>
And our time was right</p>
Keep a place for me, for me</p>
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing</p>
It's nothing, it's nothing</p>
Keep a place for me, for me</p>
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry</p>
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes</p>
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO</p>
That's like never cause I made you use your self control</p>
And you made me lose my self control, my self control</p>
Keep a place for me, for me</p>
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing</p>
Keep a place for me</p>
It's nothing, it's nothing</p>
It's nothing, it's nothing</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave</p>
Take down some summer time</p>
Give up, just tonight, night, night</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you got someone comin'</p>
You're spitting game, oh you got it</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave</p>
Take down some summer time</p>
Give up, just tonight, night, night</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you got someone comin'</p>
You're spitting game, oh you got it</p>
(Nobody else, nobody else)</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave</p>
Take down some summer time</p>
Give up, just tonight, night, night</p>
I, I, I</p>
Know you got someone comin'</p>
You're spitting game, oh you got it</p>
</p>
