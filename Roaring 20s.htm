<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>Broadway is black like a sinkhole</p>
Everyone raced to the suburbs</p>
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers</p>
This is the oddest of summers</p>
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate</p>
Strange situations, I get anxious</p>
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite</p>
But pray that they don't call me thankless</p>
My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest</p>
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet</p>
This is my roaring, roaring 20's</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
My roaring, roaring 20s</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I want, I wanna go home</p>
Oscars and Emmy's and Grammy's</p>
Everyone here is a trophy</p>
And I'm sipping bourbon</p>
The future's uncertain</p>
The past on the pavement below me</p>
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate</p>
So unaware of my status</p>
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid</p>
Designer me up in straight jackets</p>
My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest</p>
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet</p>
This is my roaring, roaring 20's</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
My roaring, roaring 20s</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I want, I wanna go home</p>
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire</p>
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight</p>
I don't know if I will survive</p>
Lighters up if you're feelin' me</p>
Fade to black if you're not mine</p>
'Cause I just need a sign, or a signal inside</p>
This is my roaring, roaring 20s</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me a, roll me a blunt</p>
This is my roaring, roaring 20s</p>
I don't even know me</p>
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home</p>
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home</p>
I wanna go home</p>
