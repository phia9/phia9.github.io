<h1>Lyrics</h1>


<p>
If you see me floatin' too many times</p>
My face will be painted in these white brick lines</p>
'Cause all my fear's invading</p>
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you</p>
Livin' on the limits</p>
And if you say goodbye too many times</p>
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time</p>
'Cause all my fear's invading</p>
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you</p>
Livin' on the limits</p>
All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the falling men</p>
Every calling cost made to your heart</p>
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me</p>
I was ever chasing fireflies</p>
Sometimes I follow a firefly</p>
It takes me into the night</p>
Baby, I just survive</p>
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry</p>
Am I losing you?</p>
Sometimes I follow a firefly</p>
It takes me into the night</p>
Baby, I just survive</p>
I got drunk, I'm sorry</p>
Am I losing you?</p>
All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the falling men</p>
(Into the night)</p>
Every calling cost made to your heart</p>
(I'm sorry, am I losing you?)</p>
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me</p>
(It takes me into the night)</p>
I was ever chasing fireflies</p>
</p>
