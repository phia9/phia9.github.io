<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Don't be cautious, don't be kind</p>
You committed, I'm your crime</p>
Push my button anytime</p>
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine</p>
Silver dollar, golden flame</p>
Dirty water, poison rain</p>
Perfect murder, take your aim</p>
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name</p>
By the way, you've been uninvited</p>
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did</p>
Copycat trying to cop my manner</p>
Watch your back when you can't watch mine</p>
Copycat trying to cop my glamour</p>
Why so sad, bunny, you can't have mine?</p>
Call me calloused, call me cold</p>
You're italic, I'm in bold</p>
Call me cocky, watch your tone</p>
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone</p>
By the way, you've been uninvited</p>
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did</p>
Copycat trying to cop my manner<p/>
Watch your back when you can't watch mine</p>
Copycat trying to cop my glamor</p>
Why so sad, bunny, you can't have mine?</p>
I would hate to see you go</p>
Hate to be the one that told you so</p>
You just crossed the line</p>
You've run out of time</p>
I'm so sorry, now you know</p>
Sorry I'm the one that told you so</p>
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry</p>
Sike</p>
By the way, you've been uninvited</p>
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did</p>
Copycat trying to cop my manner</p>
Watch your back when you can't watch mine</p>
Copycat trying to cop my glamour</p>
Why so sad, bunny, you can't have mine?</p>
